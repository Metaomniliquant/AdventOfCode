## Hypothesis

We believe that [doing this/building this/creating this]
Will result in [this outcome]
We will know we have succeeded when:
- [Measurable criterion 1]
- [Measurable criterion 2]
- [Measurable criterion 3]

## Context

<!-- Provide background information about the current state -->
<!-- Link to relevant documentation, issues, or pull requests -->
<!-- Describe why this hypothesis is important -->

**Current State:**


**Related Documentation:**
- [GitHub Copilot Development Guide](../../docs/github-copilot-development-guide.md)
- [Hypothesis-Driven Design Guide](../../docs/HYPOTHESIS_DRIVEN_DESIGN.md)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Specific deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 3]
- [ ] All tests pass (BDD, unit, integration)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (if applicable)

## Success Metrics

**Primary Metric:**
<!-- Main metric to track (e.g., performance improvement, reduced errors, faster onboarding) -->

**Secondary Metrics:**
<!-- Supporting metrics -->

**Measurement Timeframe:**
<!-- When to measure results (e.g., immediately, after 1 week, after 30 days) -->

## Implementation Approach

<!-- Optional: Describe the planned approach -->
<!-- For code: BDD → ATDD → TDD → Red → Green → Refactor -->
<!-- For documentation: Identify needs → Structure → Write → Validate -->

## Related Issues/PRs

<!-- Link to related issues or pull requests -->
